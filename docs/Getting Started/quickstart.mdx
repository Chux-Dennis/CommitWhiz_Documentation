# Quick Start

Now that you have CommitWhiz installed , what's next??

After CommitWhiz is installed, the ***cwz*** command is used when working with this package.

**To get started , run:**

```bash title="cmd"
cwz init 
```

This creates a ***whiz.config.js*** file at the root directory (same level as package.json)


```js title="whiz.config.js"
import {Whiz} from "commitwhiz"

const whizConfig = Whiz.config({
    key:process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY,
    useTextEditor:false,
    autoPush:true,
    autoPushOptions:{
      branch:"main",
      remote:"origin"
    }
})

export default whizConfig

```

:::tip Module Compatability
Your config file will use require/module.exports if your module type is commonjs in your package.json
:::

You are advised to include your config file in your **.gitgnore**

:::info Typescript Variant
A typescript variant of the config file would be rolled out in later versions, to ensure language consistency in your development enviornment
:::

### Adding to staging area

Commitwhiz does not take care of adding to staging area .

```bash title="git"
git add .
```

### Whizzing your commits!


To get your detailed , meaning commit message with CommitWhiz , you run :

```bash title="cmd"
cwz commit
```

You can edit a provided commit message if it does not meet your needs. 

They can be edited with a text editor if ***useTextEditor*** in your config file is true.


### Automating your Git Workflow

We believe that you should focus on coding and let CommitWhiz focus on your Git workflow and deployments.

If you have ***autoPush*** and ***autoPushOptions*** (branch & remote) set , after commit is successfull it automatically pushes your code to GitHub.
